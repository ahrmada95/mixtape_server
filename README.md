# MixTape Server

Express server implementation for the MixTape project. This is required for functionality! 

NOTE: Music is provided in person, not uploaded for copy-right purposes.

## To Run:

1. First store music and album art within a directory called "music." This directory must be stored at the root of the mixtape_server project directory. 
2. This server must run before the actual app! 
3. To activate the server, run
### `node mixtape_db.js`
